alt"Personal Website"  height="300"

a nice movie.I t's a story about an eager young cop (Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), and her investigation involves chase scenes (one is prolonged and particularly intense) and jump-scare predator attacks, as well as an explosive crash, sneaking around in dark rooms, allusions to mob activity, kidnapping, threatened torture (a crime boss wants to "ice" key characters -- i.e. throw them in frozen water to drown), and bullying. No one is seriously hurt, but there are times when it seems that they have been/will be. Expect
 regular use of insult language like "stupid," "jerk," "dumb," "butt," etc., 
humor related to "naturalist" animals who choose not to wear clothes, and some sexy, sparkly ensembles
 worn by Gazelle, a pop star voiced by Shakira. There are a lot of jokes for adults that 
will go way over kids' head (references to The Godfather, the DMV, and Breaking Bad, for instanc
e), but there's plenty for younger audiences to laugh at, too, and it all comes w
rapped in great messages about courage, empathy, tolerance, teamwork, a
nd the dangers of reducing others to stereotypes.</p>
